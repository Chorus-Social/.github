👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

Chorus is a fresh start, a clean slate, something new to disrupt the throttling grasp of big tech on our very thoughts. Chorus is a place to speak your mind, sing it loud from the hilltops, anything and everything is welcome here (aside from purely malicious activities), if you can justify it, you can post it.

Chorus gives the power to the people, with a revolutionary new moderation model that does away with the traditional "moderators vs members" mantra that we've seen time and time again to no avail. You're the master of your own Chorus, you get a say in whether a post or comment is harmful. Chorus will not remove posts that are deemed harmful, instead these will be labelled as such. We will not quite our Chorus for anyone.

Speak your mind. Find your tune. **Join our Chorus.**
