⚠️ A Note on Our Journey:
You've found us at the very beginning! We believe in building in the open, and that means you're seeing the project in its earliest stages. Many of the features and concepts described here are part of our vision and are not yet implemented. We're so excited to build this with you, and we appreciate your patience as we bring Chorus to life.

<strong>Chorus</strong> is a fresh start, a clean slate, a place to disrupt the throttling grasp of big tech on our very thoughts. It’s a network built on the belief that everyone deserves to be heard, not just the loudest voices in the room. This is a place to speak your mind, sing it from the hilltops, and find your own tune.

We're building this in the open from day one, because transparency isn't just a feature—it's our foundation.

Core Principles

Chorus is more than just a platform; it's a promise. We're guided by a few simple, unshakable beliefs:

🔒 True Anonymity: Your identity is your own. We use a simple, secure authentication key with no requirement for emails, passwords, or personal information.

🗳️ Direct Democracy: Power to the people—literally. The community governs itself through a unique, transparent moderation system. No appointed moderators, no secret rules.

📖 Open Platform: The entire network is built as an open API. We're not building a walled garden; we're providing the tools for you to build your own experiences.

✨ Transparency: The moderation process is public, and the platform's development is completely open and documented. You're watching it happen right now!

🌈 How to Get Involved

You've found us at the very beginning of our journey, and we're so glad you're here. This is the perfect time to help shape the future of Chorus.

Follow the Journey: Watch this space! We're building everything in public.

Share Your Ideas: Have a thought, a suggestion, or a critique? We'd love to hear it. Open an issue in the relevant repository to start a conversation.

Contribute Code: Feeling inspired? We welcome contributions from everyone. Check out our project boards and see what's on the roadmap.

👩‍💻 The Chorus Ecosystem

Chorus is a decoupled system designed for security, scalability, and openness. Here are the core components:

Chorus Stage: This is the central backend API—the heart of the entire network, built with Python, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy.

Chorus Voice: The official flagship desktop client (coming soon!).

Chorus Audience: A simple, read-only web viewer that will serve initially as the project's public landing page.

Chorus Ticketbox: A single, secure webpage for generating new anonymous user keys.
